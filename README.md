Here's a professional `README.md` for a GitHub repository that demonstrates how to run a **CTF pwnable challenge in a chroot-like jail using [NSJail](https://github.com/google/nsjail)**. This README includes:

- Project purpose
- Generalized, secure setup script
- Instructions for building NSJail from source
- Docker integration note

# 🛡️ Pwnables Jail with NSJail (Google Sandbox Tool)

This project demonstrates how to isolate and serve CTF-style pwnable challenges using [`nsjail`](https://github.com/google/nsjail) — a powerful sandboxing tool developed by Google. The approach is compatible with Docker and ideal for securely deploying challenges in a contained environment.

## 📦 Features

- 🔐 Run binaries in a secure chroot jail using NSJail
- 🧩 Automatically gather and copy binary dependencies into the jail
- 🛠️ Works without Docker, but can be containerized easily
- 🧪 Supports forking network services using `socat` inside the jail

---

## ⚙️ NSJail Installation (From Source)

````bash
# Install dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git build-essential libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libnl-route-3-dev libcap-dev libprotobuf-c-dev pkg-config libtool automake bison flex

# Clone NSJail
git clone https://github.com/google/nsjail.git
cd nsjail

# Build
make -j$(nproc)

# Optionally, move binary to /usr/local/bin
sudo cp nsjail /usr/local/bin/


---

## 🚀 Setup Script (Generalized)

Here's the improved version of your setup script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set base jail path
JAIL_BASE="${HOME}/ctf_jail"
CHALLENGE_NAME="broken_shell"
CHALLENGE_PATH="${JAIL_BASE}/PWN_1/${CHALLENGE_NAME}"

# Create jail directory
mkdir -p "$CHALLENGE_PATH"

# Copy binary to /usr/local/bin for dependency resolution
sudo cp "./${CHALLENGE_NAME}" /usr/local/bin/

# List of commands to include in jail
COMMANDS=("nohup" "cat" "socat" "ls" "clear" "sh" "nc" "bash" "${CHALLENGE_NAME}")

# Copy commands and their libraries
for cmd in "${COMMANDS[@]}"; do
    cmd_path=$(command -v "$cmd")
    if [[ -z "$cmd_path" ]]; then
        echo "Warning: '$cmd' not found, skipping..."
        continue
    fi

    mkdir -p "$CHALLENGE_PATH$(dirname "$cmd_path")"
    cp "$cmd_path" "$CHALLENGE_PATH$cmd_path"

    for lib in $(ldd "$cmd_path" | awk '{print $3}' | grep '^/'); do
        mkdir -p "$CHALLENGE_PATH$(dirname "$lib")"
        cp "$lib" "$CHALLENGE_PATH$lib"
    done
done

# Set up /proc
sudo mkdir -p "$CHALLENGE_PATH/proc"
sudo mount -t proc proc "$CHALLENGE_PATH/proc"

# Set up /dev/null
sudo mkdir -p "$CHALLENGE_PATH/dev"
sudo mknod -m 666 "$CHALLENGE_PATH/dev/null" c 1 3 || true
sudo chmod 666 "$CHALLENGE_PATH/dev/null"
sudo mount --bind /dev/null "$CHALLENGE_PATH/dev/null"

echo "✅ Jail environment is ready."
````

## 🔐 Running the Challenge Inside the Jail

Start the jailed shell with NSJail:

```bash
sudo nsjail -Mo --chroot "$CHALLENGE_PATH" --disable_clone_newnet -- /usr/bin/sh
```

Once inside the jailed environment:

```sh
cd /usr/bin
nohup socat TCP-LISTEN:15027,reuseaddr,fork EXEC:./broken_shell > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

---

## 🐳 Docker Integration (Optional)

You can integrate this setup inside a Docker container for better portability. Here’s a basic idea:

```dockerfile
FROM debian:bullseye

RUN apt update && apt install -y socat bash netcat procps coreutils

COPY nsjail /usr/local/bin/
COPY jail_setup.sh /root/
COPY broken_shell /usr/local/bin/

RUN chmod +x /root/jail_setup.sh && /root/jail_setup.sh

CMD ["nsjail", "-Mo", "--chroot", "/root/ctf_jail/PWN_1/broken_shell", "-- /usr/bin/sh"]
```

---

## 🧠 Notes

- NSJail supports `cgroups`, `seccomp`, and `user namespaces`. You can enable those for stricter isolation.
- If you're not running as root, ensure you have necessary capabilities (e.g. via Docker `--cap-add=SYS_ADMIN`).
- Make sure your challenge binary is **static or properly resolved** to prevent runtime errors.
